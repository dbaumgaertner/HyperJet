# HyperJet
> Automatic differentiation with hyper-dual numbers

## What it is

HyperJet is a small but powerful library to enable automatic computation of derivatives. It implements a basic _forward mode_ automatic differentiation algorithm to compute the _first and second derivative_ of an expression with respect to multiple input variables.

The library was initially developed to simplify the _development of isogeometric finite elements_. It can be easily integrated into existing _Python_ and _C++_ code.
